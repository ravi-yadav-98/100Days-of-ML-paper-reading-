### [paper link:](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf)
-  conditional adversarial networks as ageneral-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems
-   Many problems in image processing, graphics, and vision involve translating an input image into a corresponding output image.
-   example: 
    1. black-white to color image
    2. day to night image
    3. sketch to image 
    4. edge to imgae
    5. labels(segementaion) to real image
-  **These all problems are related to map pixel to pixel**
-  **Conditional adversarial nets are a general-purpose solution that appears to work well on a wide variety of these problems.**
